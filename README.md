Homework 3 (Python)
The csv file for PyPoll was too big so I had to compress it into a CSV file to upload it cause the limit was 25MB
The homework was quite alright though I did use some help from google o get some information and ideas to get by some problems I had while coding, but I put most of my reasoning in comments in the code to explain my reasoning
